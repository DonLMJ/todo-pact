Project Overview

This project involves two main components:

Todo Website: A user interface designed to interact with the Todo Service.
Todo Service (Provider): Offers functionalities related to managing todos, such as listing, adding, completing, and deleting todos.
Project Structure
src/todo.routes.ts: Contains the client interface built using Express, facilitating communication with the Todo Service. This component operates without a database.
__tests__/api.spec.ts: Houses API integration tests, which could potentially be integrated into component integration tests.
__tests__/consumer.test.ts: Features consumer-driven Pact tests. Here, a mock server is initiated on a random port to mimic the behavior of the provider service and verify that the contract is upheld from the consumer's perspective.
Testing Approach
Executing these tests generates a Pact file, typically found in consumer/pacts/. This file serves as a validation mechanism for our assumptions on the provider's behavior.

Given that the client version may not always align with the deployed API, it's crucial to specify the state of both the consumer and the provider when running contract tests. This ensures that the tests accurately reflect real-world scenarios.

Next Steps
Pact Broker Integration: Consider integrating with a Pact Broker to publish contracts. Docker can be leveraged for this purpose. Utilize pact-cli or can-i-deploy tools to verify whether the application can be safely deployed, both for the client and the provider.
By following these steps, we can ensure robust communication between the components while maintaining consistency and reliability in our services.
